#### `EVENT_BEFORE_STATE_CHANGE`
Triggered *before* an organization state change occurs.

```php
    Event::on(
        \flipbox\organizations\services\Records::class,
        \flipbox\organizations\services\Records::EVENT_BEFORE_STATE_CHANGE,
        function (\flipbox\organizations\events\ChangeStateEvent $e) {
            // Changed state from $e->organization->state to $e->to
    );
```

#### `EVENT_AFTER_STATE_CHANGE`
Triggered *after* an organization state change occurs.

```php
    Event::on(
        \flipbox\organizations\services\Records::class,
        \flipbox\organizations\services\Records::EVENT_AFTER_STATE_CHANGE,
        function (\flipbox\organizations\events\ChangeStateEvent $e) {
            // Changed state to $e->to
    );
```

## Views

        \flipbox\organizations\cp\controllers\view\OrganizationsController::EVENT_REGISTER_ORGANIZATION_ACTIONS,

    );
```
