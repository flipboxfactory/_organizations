## Chain Setting

All of the params (above) can also be accessed and chain-set.  The methods are named the same as the property.

Here is an example:

::: code

```twig
{% set query = craft.organizations.organizationTypes.getQuery() %}
{% do query.handle('foo').name('Bar') %}
```

```php
use flipbox\organizations\Organizations;

$query = Organizations::getInstance()->getOrganizationTypes()->getQuery()
    ->handle('foo')
    ->name('Bar');
```
